#Queue

1.Circular Queue
2. Non-Circular Queue

Two Pointers:-
1.Head Pointer (Element Removed from Head Pointer)
2.Tail Pointer (Element Added to Tail Pointer)


#NON-CIRCULAR QUEUE#

.Both Pointer Points to the same Node means that the Queue is Empty
.TailPointer == len(array) means Queue Full!

Enqueue()
.if TailPointer == len(array) means Queue Full
.if HeadPointer == -1 then HeadPointer = 0
.TailPointer = TailPointer + 1
.array[TailPointer] = value

Dequeue()
.if HeadPointer > TailPointer or HeadPointer < 0 means Queue Empty!
.HeadPointer = HeadPointer + 1
.HeadPointer[HeadPointer - 1]
